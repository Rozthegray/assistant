Scaling Plan Breakdown

For starter plus evaluation accounts, you can open a maximum number of contracts per account size for the entire evaluation period.
 For the $50,000 account, it is 3 mini or 30 micro contracts.

For the $100,000 account, it is 6 mini or 60 micro contracts.

For the $50,000 account, it is 9 mini or 90 micro contracts.

 

For starter plus simulated funded accounts, you can only open half as many micros as you could during the evaluation stage. This is the starter plus scaling plan. You start with the minimum contract size for the associated account size, and as you make more profits, you will be able to open more contracts.
