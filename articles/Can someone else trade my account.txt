Can someone else trade my account?
Updated over a week ago

Every account must be traded exclusively by its owner throughout all challenge phases. Modifications/assistance/outsourcing after progressing to a new stage = breach.

No one else may trade your account, and device sharing (same PC/phone as another user) is forbidden and will result in breach/account failure.

Abide by this and show your commitment to the process!

t is a requirement that all accounts participating in our challenges are exclusively traded by the account owner without any alterations once a phase has been successfully completed. Failure to comply with this rule will be considered a breach of the account.

 

To maintain the integrity of the challenge and ensure a fair evaluation of your trading skills, it is crucial that you refrain from making any modifications or allowing others to trade on your behalf once you have progressed to a new stage. Only the account owner should be actively involved in trading activities for the respective accounts and simulated challenges.
