Starter Account Overview

Qualify fast for a live funded account with MyFundedFuture Starter plan — no consistency rules and payouts in as little as 5 days.

Note: The $100k and $150k Starter accounts are no longer available.

At MyFunded Futures, we understand that a trader's career hinges on their ability to progress without compromise. To support this progression from simulated funding stages to live funding stages, we have introduced the Starter Account at MyFunded Futures.

Main Objective: Transition to Live Funding
Our primary objective is to guide traders toward stable income and promote them to a live funding environment.

The Starter Plan is designed to nurture a mindset focused on steadily growing the account.

Note: In the evaluation stages there aren't any consistency rules. Traders may pass the evaluation in a single trading day.

Benefits of the Starter Account

Easiest Path to Live Funding: Consistent traders can be utilized for proprietary funding methods.
Potential Weekly Payouts: After five winning days, traders can receive payouts, e.g., 5 days of $100 (50K account).
Daily Loss Limits: Ensure you have another day to survive in the markets. Daily Loss Limit does not disqualify your account.
Competitive Pricing: Low barrier of entry with some of the most competitive prices in the market.
No Buffer Zone: No buffer zone in starter plans. Reach 5 profitable days, eligible for payout. Drawdown moves to balance +100 at payout request.
