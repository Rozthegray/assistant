2% Price Limit Rule | My Funded Futures Help Center

At MyFundedFutures, we prioritize protecting our traders from high volatility and hazardous market conditions. We strictly prohibit trading when a product is within 2% of a CME price limit. This ensures our traders are not exposed to extreme market losses.

- Price limits: Maximum price range per contract, per session.
- When the limit is hit: Markets may halt, stay in limit, or stop based on rules.

Where enforced: Sim Funded Account and Live Funded Account.

How to comply:
- Price limits change daily (see CME's Price Limits page, updated 5:05 PM EST).
- Check your platform's "Net Change %".
- Ensure you're not trading within 2% of either price limit.

Example: For a 5% price limit, stop trading if you're within 2% of it (i.e. 3%-5% above/below ref price).

This rule is to protect both firm and traders. Learn your contract specs and always be aware of price limits.
