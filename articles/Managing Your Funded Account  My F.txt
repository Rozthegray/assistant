Managing Your Funded Account | My Funded Futures Help Center

Daily Management Tips:
Effective daily management is crucial for consistent success. Consider implementing a 1-2 loss or win limit per day to maintain discipline. This helps you avoid overtrading or chasing losses. After each trading session, journal your trades while the thoughts are fresh. Reflecting on your decisions, both successful and less so, can be a valuable learning experience. Additionally, remain mindful of market conditions and take breaks when needed to stay focused and avoid emotional trading.

Ensuring Account Longevity:
To ensure the longevity of your sim-funded account, it's essential to plan your withdrawals thoughtfully. While it's tempting to take out all your profits, consider giving yourself a reasonable payout while leaving a buffer to manage fluctuations. In addition to the buffer zone, aim to scale up your account gradually, taking on more risk only when your balance allows. By managing withdrawals and your risk levels smartly, you can protect your account's longevity and maintain financial stability.
