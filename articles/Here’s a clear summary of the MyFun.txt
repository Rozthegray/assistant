Here’s a **clear summary of the MyFundedFutures Evaluation-To-Live Scaling Program** based on the details you provided:

**How Scaling Works**
- When you pass an Evaluation-To-Live plan, you start with a $2,000 live-funded account.
- As you hit specific profit milestones, your account size, daily loss limit (DLL), and maximum contract allowance increase according to your progress.
- If you pass with multiple accounts at once:
  - Two accounts = $4,000 starting balance, $1,000 DLL, 2 minis/20 micros.
  - Three accounts = $6,000 starting balance, $1,500 DLL, 3 minis/30 micros.

**Progression Table**

| Account Size | Daily Loss Limit (DLL) | Max Contracts        |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| $2,000*      | $500                  | 1 Mini / 10 Micro    |
| $4,000*      | $1,000                | 2 Mini / 20 Micro    |
| $6,000*      | $1,500                | 3 Mini / 30 Micro    |
| $8,000       | $2,000                | 4 Mini / 40 Micro    |
| $10,000      | $2,500                | 5 Mini / 50 Micro    |
| $20,000+     | Custom                | Custom               |

*If starting with 2 or 3 accounts, see notes above.

**Key Rules and Details**
- **Profit Split**: Stays at 80% for traders, regardless of account size.
- **Contract Size Increases**: Each scaling milestone unlocks access to additional contracts.
- **Scaling Rules**: If your account falls below the threshold for your current scaling level, your contract and DLL decrease accordingly.
- **Custom Scaling**: After $20,000, custom scaling plans are available via a risk manager if you show consistent profitability.
- **No Time Limit**: You can progress at your own pace—no deadline to reach targets.
- **Withdrawals**: You do not need to withdraw profits to scale, but withdrawing will lower your eligible contracts and DLL based on new balance.

**Example Scenarios**
- If you pass with a single account: Start at $2,000, $500 DLL, 1 mini/10 micros.
- Pass with 2 accounts: Start at $4,000, $1,000 DLL, 2 minis/20 micros.
- Pass with 3 accounts: Start at $6,000, $1,500 DLL, 3 minis/30 micros.
