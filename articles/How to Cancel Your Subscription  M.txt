Updated over a week ago

Navigating the process of canceling a subscription can sometimes be daunting. At MyFundedFutures (MFFU), we aim to make this process as straightforward as possible. Whether you're taking a break, reassessing your trading strategies, or simply want to make changes to your current plan, here's a step-by-step guide to help you cancel your subscription with ease.

Step-by-Step Cancellation Process
Log In to Your Account: Start by logging into your MFFU dashboard using your registered credentials.
Navigate to the 'Billing' Section: On the left side of your dashboard, you'll find the 'Billing' tab. Click on it to view your current subscription details.
Select 'Manage Subscription': Within the 'Billing' section, there will be an option labeled 'Manage Subscription'. Click on it to proceed.
Choose 'Cancel Subscription': You'll be presented with various options related to your subscription. Find and select the 'Cancel Subscription' button.
Confirm Cancellation: A prompt will appear asking you to confirm your decision. Click 'Yes' to finalize the cancellation.

Things to Consider Before Cancelling
Review Benefits: Before canceling, take a moment to review the benefits and features you'll be losing access to. This ensures you're making an informed decision.
Reset: Once an evaluation account is cancelled, it is no longer eligible to be reset even if the cancellation is a future date.
Pending Payouts: Ensure you've received all pending payouts or addressed any outstanding financial matters.
Data Access: Remember, post-cancellation, you might lose access to certain data or trading insights.
Feedback: If there's something specific you're unhappy with, consider reaching out to our support team. We're always eager to assist and improve.
