Connecting to Different Platforms at MFFU
Updated over a week ago

Navigating the world of trading platforms can be daunting, but at MFFU, we aim to make the process as seamless as possible. Here’s a step-by-step guide to connecting to our supported platforms:

TradingView, Tradovate, and NinjaTrader:
- Head over to https://trader.tradovate.com and sign in.
- You’ll be prompted to sign an agreement for live market data access.
- Once signed, your account will update and you’ll have access to live data.

Follow these instructions to access live market data on your platform.

This ensures you have the necessary permissions and access for full trading functionality.
