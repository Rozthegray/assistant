Qualify fast for a live funded account with MyFundedFuture Starter plan — no consistency rules and payouts in as little as 5 days.

Updated over a week ago
 Note: The $100k and $150k Starter accounts are no longer available.

At MyFunded Futures, we understand that a trader's career hinges on their ability to progress without compromise. 

 

To support this progression from simulated funding stages to live funding stages, we have introduced the Starter Account at MyFunded Futures.

​ 

Main Objective: Transition to Live Funding
Our primary objective is to guide traders toward stable income and promote them to a live funding environment. We are confident that the new offering can achieve this goal.

 

The Starter Plan is designed to nurture a mindset focused on steadily growing the account. 

Note: In the evaluation stages there aren't any consistency rules. Traders may pass the evaluation in a single trading day.

Benefits of the Starter Account
Easiest Path to Live Funding: We seek consistent traders who can potentially be utilized for proprietary funding methods.

Potential Weekly Payouts: After five winning days, traders can receive payouts, for examples on 5 days of $100 (50K account).

Daily Loss Limits: These limits ensure you have another day to survive in the markets. Daily Loss Limit does not disqualify your account.

Competitive Pricing: MyFundedFutures offers a low barrier of entry with some of the most competitive prices in the market.

No Buffer Zone: We have removed the buffer zone concept in our starter plans! As soon as you reach 5 profitable days, you are eligible for a payout! Drawdown will move to balance +100 at payout request.
