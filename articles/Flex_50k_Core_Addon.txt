How Payouts Work
After five winning days (each with Net PNL ≥ $100), you become eligible for a payout request. You may request 50% of your net profits per payout, up to $3,000. The other 50% of profits must remain in your account. Standard 80/20 profit split applies (80% trader / 20% firm). Minimum payout request: $250. After the first payout, the Maximum Loss Limit locks at $50,100.

Payout Example #1
Trader records 5 qualifying winning days, netting $4,000 total profit. Eligible payout: $2,000 (50%). After profit split, trader receives $1,600. Remaining $2,000 stays as balance.

Payout Example #2
Trader records 5 qualifying winning days, netting $10,000 total profit. Eligible payout capped at $3,000. After profit split, trader receives $2,400. Remaining $7,000 stays as balance.
