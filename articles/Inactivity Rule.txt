Inactivity Rule | My Funded Futures Help Center

For sim-funded accounts: To remain active, you must place at least one trade every 7 calendar days. If you need a break, notify support ahead of time for an exception.

No inactivity minimum for evaluation phase—trade at your pace. However, subscription continues even if not trading.

Being inactive (without prior notice) may breach your account.

Contact support with any questions on account activity!
