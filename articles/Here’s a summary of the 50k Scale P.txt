**What is the Flex Add-On?**
- **Flex Add-On introduces a new payout structure for the 50k Scale Plan.**
- It is **FREE** when purchasing the $50k Scale Plan ($127).
- **Must be added at purchase**—cannot apply retroactively.
- **Foundational rules (evaluation, live transition)** remain unchanged; only payout rules are different.

**How Flex Payouts Work**
- After **5 winning days** (each with Net PNL ≥ $100), you become eligible for a payout request.
- **Payout Amount:** You can request **50%** of your net profits per payout, up to a **maximum of $6,000**.
- The **other 50% of profits stays in your account.**
- Standard **80/20 profit split** applies (you keep 80%, firm receives 20%).
- **Minimum payout request is $250.**
- After the first payout, **Maximum Loss Limit resets to $50,100**.

**Example Calculations**
