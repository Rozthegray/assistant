Q: What happens to my Sim Funded or Evaluation accounts when I go Live?
A:

The account/s you promote to Live are closed.

Starter & Starter Plus Sim/Evaluation accounts are placed in a dormant state—you may leave them inactive or request a refund if eligible.

Any Expert Sim/Evaluation accounts remaining are closed and refunded.

Q: What funding do I receive on my Live account?
A: Your Live account is seeded with a risk-managed balance aligned to your Starter or Starter Plus plan:

$50K plan → $2,500 starting balance

$100K plan → $3,500 starting balance

$150K plan → $5,000 starting balance

You’ll also receive plan-specific risk parameters (Daily Loss Limit, contract limits, etc.) in your onboarding package.

Expert Plans
Q: How do I transition to a Live account from an Expert plan?

A: Once you’ve shown sustained profitability, consistency, and disciplined risk management under your Expert Sim account, a Risk Manager will proactively reach out to initiate your Live onboarding.

 

Q: What performance criteria trigger an Expert review?

A: We evaluate your trading holistically—profitability over time, drawdown control, and adherence to our Consistency Rules. When your results meet our Expert benchmarks (typically around cumulative payouts in the $20K–$25K range and consistent trading behavior), you become eligible. For full details, see our Consistency Rules.

Live Account Considerations
Q: What happens to my Sim accounts after I go Live?

A: All Sim accounts are either closed or marked dormant as described above. From that point on, you trade company capital in a professional Live environment under real-time risk monitoring.

Q: If I breach my Live account, can I return to Sim?

A: Most likely—depending on your overall performance and trading history, you may be offered entry into our structured Path Back to Live program, where you’ll work to demonstrate consistency again before regaining Live status.
