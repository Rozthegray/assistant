Consistency Rule at MyFunded Futures (Core, Scale and Pro Plans)
Updated over a week ago

MyFundedFutures now uses simple, standardized rules for all evaluations.

Consistency rule: No single day's profit may exceed 50% of total evaluation profits earned. (For 50k account: Target $3,000, max single day profit should be $1,500 or less. Exceeding? Just continue trading until the average falls below 50%.)

You are not disqualified for exceeding it—you just keep trading!
