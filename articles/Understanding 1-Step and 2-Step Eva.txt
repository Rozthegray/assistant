1 Step Plan: $444, single $3,000 target, $1,500 DD, 20% consistency, 3 mini/30 micro, no inactivity limit. Reset $444.

2 Step Plan: $197 phase one, $3,000/40%/3m/30mc, no inactivity; $3,000/50%/3m/30mc, must trade every 7 days. Reset $197.

Live account: $2,000 allocation, $500 initial DLL, 80% profit split, micro scaling 1:10, EOD trailing locks at $2,000.

Key Differences:
- 1 Step: simpler, higher cost, one profit target.
- 2 Step: two phases, lower cost, more steps.
