Take the Challenge with your Preferred Plan
 

Navigating the Perils of Misused Freedom
While the Expert and Pro accounts provide traders with the latitude to explore their trading style, it's essential to recognize that this autonomy does not equate to unchecked or careless trading behavior. The misuse of this freedom can lead to excessive risk-taking and other undesirable trading practices. To navigate the intricacies of the Expert and Pro accounts effectively, traders should heed the following guiding principles:

Employ a Consistent Trading Plan: Develop and adhere to a consistent trading plan encompassing position sizing, stop-loss placement, and profit-taking strategies.

Prioritize Effective Risk Management: Make risk management a top priority to safeguard your capital and mitigate potential losses effectively.

Steer Clear of High-Risk Strategies: Avoid high-risk, high-reward strategies that may expose your account to substantial drawdowns.

Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Keep your focus on long-term account growth rather than seeking quick gains.

Leveraging Consistency for Success
Consistency serves as the cornerstone for achieving sustainable success on the Expert and Pro accounts. While there are no strict rules dictating behavior, traders should view their freedom as an opportunity to implement a well-structured trading strategy. By adhering to a consistent approach, traders can unlock numerous benefits, including:

Enhanced Risk Control: Consistency bolsters risk management practices, protecting your capital from potential threats.

A Resilient Trading Portfolio: Consistency leads to the development of a robust and resilient trading portfolio capable of withstanding diverse market conditions.

The Building Blocks of Consistent Trading
At MyFunded Futures, we firmly believe that consistent, disciplined trading is the bedrock of long-term success. This consistency should manifest in various aspects of your trading strategy:

Uniform Position Sizing, Stops, and Targets: A consistent trading plan entails uniformity in position sizes, clear stop-loss and take-profit levels that align with your strategy, and well-defined targets for each trade.

Avoidance of Maximum Contract Sizes: While we offer flexibility in choosing contract sizes, resist the urge to employ maximum or oversized contract sizes in every trade.

No Flipping Contracts for Activity's Sake: Discouraging frequent contract flipping merely for the sake of showing trading activity is integral to maintaining a consistent trading approach.

Consistency in Trading Sizes: Maintain uniform trading sizes across your portfolio to aid risk management and ensure prudent capital allocation.

Steering Clear of Dollar-Cost Averaging and High-Frequency Trading: Unless these strategies align with your goals, focus on an approach that matches your risk tolerance and trading style.

Transparency and Accountability
Transparency and accountability are foundational principles at MyFunded Futures. We establish clear expectations for our traders and entrust them to uphold these principles. Nevertheless, traders should be aware that violations of our Consistent Trading Policy may result in consequences.

 

Consequences for Violations
Traders should understand that breaches of the Consistent Trading Policy could lead to various actions, including:

Immediate Account Restrictions: In cases of inconsistencies in your trading behavior, we may impose account restrictions to prevent further deviations.

Penalties: Depending on the severity and recurrence of violations, traders may incur penalties that could impact their trading capital.

Account Termination: For repeated or severe violations, MyFunded Futures retains the right to terminate the trader's account.

While these measures are unwelcome, they are essential to uphold fairness across our trading community and ensure its long-term sustainability.

 

Striking the Right Balance with Freedom
Expert and Pro accounts at MyFunded Futures grant traders the unique autonomy to shape their trading journey. However, this freedom must be exercised responsibly, grounded in consistency. By adopting a balanced approach that emphasizes risk management and long-term sustainability, traders on Expert and Pro accounts can achieve remarkable success.
