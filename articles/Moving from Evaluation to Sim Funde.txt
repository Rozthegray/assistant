Moving from Evaluation to Sim Funded Account | My Funded Futures Help Center

The Transition Process:
Transitioning from the evaluation stage to a sim-funded account is an exciting step in your trading journey. It begins with reaching your profit target during the evaluation stage. Once your end-of-day balance reflects that you've passed, you'll receive an email confirming your success. Your account will then undergo a brief review (typically in less than 24 hours), and you'll be notified of the results via email.

What Changes and What Remains:
With your new sim-funded account, you'll notice some changes and some things that remain the same. Your sim-funded account will have 'SIM' in the account name, but you'll still use the same login credentials as before. Your maximum drawdown will still lock at the initial balance + $100 after the drawdown + $100 has been reached. Now, you'll need to consider your strategy for withdrawing profits, taking into account the buffer zone and payout policy, which can be found in the payout policy overview on the Intercom Help Desk article. It's important to understand these changes to make the most of your funded account.

Managing Your New Account:
Managing your sim-funded account is a crucial part of your trading success. The dashboard is your go-to tool, providing a comprehensive view of your analytics once the end-of-day data is updated. You can keep track of your progress in your sim-funded account, ensuring you're on the right path to meet your trading goals. Additionally, you can monitor your remaining drawdown through your trading platform, which empowers you to stay in control of your trading activities and risk management.

This transition marks a significant step toward achieving your trading aspirations, and effectively managing your new sim-funded account is the key to long-term success in the world of trading.
