At MyFunded Futures, while we strive to provide opportunities to traders worldwide, we regret to inform you that we are unable to accept traders from the below countries due to regulatory restrictions and compliance requirements. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. 

Furthermore, to ensure the integrity and security of our platform and comply with legal and regulatory obligations, traders must meet certain eligibility criteria. This includes being of legal age to engage in trading activities in their respective jurisdictions.

Additionally, traders are required to verify their identity by submitting Know Your Customer (KYC) documents as part of our identity verification process. These documents may include government-issued identification, proof of address, and any other documents necessary to establish the trader's identity and comply with regulatory guidelines.

We place a high priority on maintaining a transparent and compliant trading environment for all our traders, and these measures help us ensure the safety and security of our platform while adhering to legal and regulatory requirements.
