MyFunded Futures Funded Account Rules and Prop Trading Challenge Guide | My Funded Futures Help Center

Congratulations on reaching the funded level at MyFundedFutures! This guide covers funded account parameters, prop trading challenge rules, and objectives for Starter, Expert, Core, Scale, and Pro plans.

Sim-Funded Account: Trade simulated capital while following prop firm rules. Pass your evaluation, then enter the sim-funded stage to trade for (virtual) profits and withdrawals.

Key Evaluation Rules:
- Profit Target: Reach the goal, don’t breach trailing drawdown or daily loss.
- Trading Activity: At least 1 trade on 5 separate days.
- Consistency Rule: 40% (Starter; no day exceeds 40% of profits); 50% for Core/Scale/Pro evals.
- Trading Hours: No weekends, follow session hours.
- No vacation pauses during evaluation, only after.

Sim-Funded Account parameters:
- Stay active: 1 trade every 7 days or notify support.
- Scaling/consistency/withdrawal rules apply per plan.

Expert/Pro rules: No scaling but avoid overleveraging; follow conduct guidelines.

General:
- Max 5 sim-funded accounts (50k accounts only).
- Don’t exceed EOD trailing loss.
- Trade consistently for possible promotion to live-funded.
- No resets for sim-funded accounts.

Daily discipline and consistency are keys. Success is about smart management and following the rules.
